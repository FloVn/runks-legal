    <p>
      This page explains how you can request deletion of your RUNKS account and/or personal data.
      RUNKS (“the App”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is currently in a pre-creation stage and may evolve over time.
      If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@runks.app">contact@runks.app</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) What you can request</h2>
  <p>You may request one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> deletion of your RUNKS account (including profile and identifiers).</li>
    <li><strong>Personal data deletion:</strong> deletion of personal data associated with your account, to the extent legally permitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Disconnection from Garmin:</strong> revocation of Garmin Connect access (stops future data imports).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How to request deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Please send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@runks.app">contact@runks.app</a> with the subject:
    <code>RUNKS Data Deletion Request</code>.
  </p>

  <p>In your email, include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The email address used for your RUNKS account (or the one used to sign in).</li>
    <li>Your request type: <em>Account deletion</em> or <em>Personal data deletion</em>.</li>
    <li>If applicable, mention that you connected Garmin Connect and want it disconnected.</li>
    <li>(Optional) Any details that help us locate your account (username/pseudonym).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Identity verification</h2>
  <p>
    To protect users, we may ask you to verify ownership of the account (for example, by replying from the
    same email used to register, or providing additional verification information).
  </p>

  <h2>4) What happens after your request</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We confirm receipt of your request by email.</li>
    <li>We will process your request within a reasonable timeframe (typically within 30 days).</li>
    <li>We will notify you once deletion is completed or if we need additional information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Garmin Connect disconnection</h2>
  <p>
    If you previously authorized Garmin Connect, you can stop future data sharing by revoking access in your
    Garmin account settings (Garmin Connect). You can also request us to disconnect the integration by emailing
    <a href="mailto:contact@runks.app">contact@runks.app</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Data that may be retained</h2>
  <p>
    We may retain limited information where required by law or for legitimate business purposes
    (e.g., security, fraud prevention, record-keeping, dispute resolution), and only for as long as necessary.
    Where possible, retained data will be minimized and/or anonymized.
  </p>
